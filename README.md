# OpsMarine Frontend

A modern frontend for the OpsMarine application — leveraging Tailwind CSS and a component-based architecture to build a responsive, clean, and efficient user interface for marine operations.

---

##  Overview

OpsMarine is designed for managing marine operations with ease and clarity. This frontend version allows you to:
- Navigate marine operation data cleanly using a responsive UI  
- Simulate or visualize data using the included `db.json` (ideal for prototyping or offline development)  
- Easily expand as the backend grows or integrates with APIs

##  Features

- **Tailwind CSS**: Lightweight and highly customizable styling  
- **Component Structure**: Easily maintainable and scalable structure under `src/`  
- **Mock Data Support**: `db.json` can be used with tools like `json-server` to mock APIs and speed up development  
- **Dev-Friendly**: Built for fast local development and rapid iteration
